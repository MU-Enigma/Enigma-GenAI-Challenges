## AI Model

## Image Prompts
Below are the approximate prompts used to generate each of the Enigma logos:

### Image 1
> "Create a dark, gothic-style logo featuring three skulls arranged in a triangle with a pentagram design on the central skull. Include scorpions and snakes intertwined around the skulls, with blood dripping from various parts. The word 'ENIGMA' should be prominently displayed above the skulls in a bold, mysterious font. Use a black and dark gray color palette with touches of red for a sinister atmosphere."

### Image 2
> "Generate a gothic, horror-themed logo with a central skull featuring glowing red eyes and a rose on the forehead. Add a scorpion on top of the skull and two snarling wolf heads on each side. The word 'ENIGMA' should be displayed below in a bold, eerie font. Surround the design with a full moon and clouds, with hints of red for a dark and intense feel."
